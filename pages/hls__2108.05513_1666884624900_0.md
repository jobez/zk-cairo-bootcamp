- This system is non-stopping, accepting new transactions, creating new blocks and always growing the state. To handle this complexity and especially the growing volume of data, the blockchain architects re-used fundamental data structures known throughout the history of computer science, but combined them in new forms.

- Blockchain platforms operate with enormous number of keys that must be looked-up from underlying data sources. Due to distribute nature, they furthermore need to be trustworthy. For these reasons, blockchain platforms try to employ effective algorithms for searching and cryptography. They mostly use and extend structures mentioned in following sections.
