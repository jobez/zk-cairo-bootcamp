- write a 'shame coin' contract where
	- the shame coin needs to have an administration address that is set in the constructor
	- the decimal places sould be set to 0
	- the administrator can send 1 shame coin at a time to other addresses (but keep the transfer function signature the same)
	- if non administrators try to transfer their shame coin, the transfer funcion will instead increase their balance by one
	- non administrators can approve the administrator (and only the administrator) to spend one token on their behalf
	- the transfer from function should just reduce the balance of the holder
	- write unit tests to show that the functionality is correct
